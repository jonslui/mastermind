========

Mastermind is a two-player code-breaking game.

In this commandline-version you have two playstyle choices.
1. Guess: in this version the computer randomly generates a code and the player has to try to guess it in 12 turns.
2. Create: The player creates a code and the computer tries to guess the correct code in 12 turns.

If you are the guesser, you will input any combination of red, green, blue, or white.
If you have correct guesses, in the correct location, the board will tell you how many by returning "Correct location: " followed by the # of correct choices.
If you have guess the correct color, but in the wrong location, the board will tell you by returning "Correct color, wrong location: " followed by the # of cases.
